The Monaco GP 2023 Qualifying Session was by far the highlight of the Season so far.

We saw an incredible Q3, with several drivers taking interim pole, after which Verstappen did what he does best - take pole.

The motivation behind this quick project was really to see what Verstappen did differently compared to Alonso in Sector 3 to gain 3 tenths and pole position even though he didn't improve across the first two sectors.

Hope you liked the views :D
